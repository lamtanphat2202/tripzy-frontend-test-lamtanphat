## Key Technical

* **Why I chose Next.js & TypeScript:**
    * I chose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because it provides a powerful React experience with routing, has a clear and easy-to-use system structure, optimizes for SEO, flexible rendering with SSR, SSG and ISR. TypeScript is used to provide type safety and improve the programming experience.
* **About Component UI:**
    * **Why choose shadcn/ui?** I chose shadcn/ui because it allows for flexible customization of components. It's built directly with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI, ensuring consistency in styling.
    * **Why are you still using Ant Design?** While shadcn/ui is very powerful for basic and intermediate components, Ant Design is more diverse in the style of each component, giving me more suitable options.
